# Exercises

A list of short programming exercises to do for practice. For most of these projects, you can use [CodePen](http://codepen.io) or host them on GitHub Pages by creating a `gh-pages` branch.

You are encouraged to write a blog post for each project detailing what you learnt and the challenges you faced.
